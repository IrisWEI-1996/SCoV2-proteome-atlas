# A direct RNA-protein interaction atlas of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human cells

SARS-CoV-2 infections pose a global health threat and an unprecedented research challenge. Among the most urgent tasks is obtaining a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions that facilitate viral replication or contribute to host defense mechanisms in infected cells. While SARS-CoV-2 co-opts cellular factors for viral translation and genome replication, a comprehensive map of the cellular proteome in direct contact with viral RNA has not been elucidated. Here, we apply RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to obtain an unbiased and quantitative picture of the human proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in infected human cells. We integrate these binding events with proteome-wide abundance changes induced by viral infection and discover known host factors required for coronavirus replication, along with regulators of RNA metabolism and host defense mechanisms among direct SARS-CoV-2 binders. Validating our RAP-MS associations, we show that CNBP, a protein linked to a specific cytokine response, directly engages the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Further, we provide evidence that the RNA-binding protein RYDEN suppresses ribosomal frame shifting during translation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Demonstrating the physiological relevance of the identified interactions, we target direct SARS-CoV-2-binding proteins and their interactors with inhibitors to manipulate viral replication. Taken together, our SARS-CoV-2 interactome is an invaluable resource that provides an unprecedented RNA-centric perspective on SARS-CoV-2 infections and enables the dissection of host dependency factors and host defense strategies, a crucial prerequisite for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
